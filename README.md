# MIPS Linked List Implementation

**Author**: Aleksandr Hovhannisyan

**Course**: CDA3101 Intro to Computer Organization (@ the University of Florida)

**Instructor**: Dr. Cheryl Resch

This source code provides a full implementation of a MIPS assembly linked list. Ample inline comments are provided 
to make the code easier to follow/decipher. 

Known drawback: because SPIM only supports the allocation of dynamic memory but does not support the deallocation of said memory,
this program inevitably runs into memory leaks when nodes are created and subsequently "deleted." 

### Running
Be sure to download the [QtSPIM](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/) simulator. Then, simply download the source file, 
load it into QtSPIM, and run.

### Warning â€“ Academic Honesty
If you're in the course, do NOT use this source code (or any parts of it) for your own submission. The instructor will
know.
