# MIPS Linked List Implementation

**Author**: Aleksandr Hovhannisyan
**Course**: CDA3101 Intro to Computer Organization (@ the University of Florida)
**Instructor**: Dr. Cheryl Resch

This source code provides a full implementation of a MIPS assembly linked list. Ample inline comments are provided 
to make the code easier to follow/decipher.

### Running
Be sure to download the [QtSPIM](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/) simulator. Then, simply download the source file, 
load it into QtSPIM, and run.

### Warning â€“ Academic Honesty
If you're in the course, do NOT use this source code (or any parts of it) for your own submission. The instructor will
know. Besides, you'll find this is a very valuable learning experience; it's best to suffer through it on your own.
